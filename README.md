# Person-of-Interest-Identifier2.0
This project is based on the Enron scandal of 2001, the data used here is the emails data of enron employees which was made public and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset). 
Here we identify people from the numerous enron employees which can be considered as 'person of interest (poi)' i.e. who may have a hand in the scandal based on their email conversations. 
The data has handpicked people classified as poi which were convicted in reality. We use a supervised learning approach with text mining techniques to build our poi identifier. 
This is a follow-up analysis (version 2) for my earlier project where I used Enron's financial data to identify person of interests.
